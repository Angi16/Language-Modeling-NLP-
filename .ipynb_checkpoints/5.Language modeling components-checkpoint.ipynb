    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "As input, we take directories containing e-books in plain text format, sourced from Project Gutenberg. We first strip extraneous text inserted by Project Gutenberg. We then pass the text through a pre-trained `nltk` punkt tokenizer to mark sentence boundaries. Finally, we tokenize words using the standard `nltk.word_tokenize()`. The `preprocess` module contains small functions for this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating probabilities\n",
    "At its core, a bigram model is a function from tokens to distributions over tokens. Let $\\#(x, y)$ be the number of times $y$ follows $x$ in the training corpus. We can define a distribution $p_x$ for a token $x$ as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_x(y) = \\frac{ \\#(x, y) }{ \\sum_{t} \\#(x, t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are both straightforward to find if we have a co-occurrence matrix. We would simply look up the value at $C_{xy}$ and divide by the sum of $C_x$. Creating the co-occurrence matrix is straightforward as well. We use a `defaultdict` of `Counter`s, which are themselves just `defaultdict`s with default 0 values. This implements a _dictionary of keys sparse matrix._ Each `Counter` corresponds to a row in the co-occurrence matrix.\n",

    "# from CounterMatrix.__init__\n",
    "self._dict = defaultdict(Counter)\n",

    "    self._dict[tokens[i]][tokens[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this co-occurrence matrix, we can create a distribution for each token as follows (simplified from final implementation). Note that the line where we find `self.total` i.e $\\sum_{t} \\#(x, t)$ requires iterating over the entire row. But that's totally fine because the matrix is sparse. We can assume almost every token has a zero probability of following this one. And we'll always be able to assume that _so there's nothing to worry about, okay?!_\n",

    "## Perplexity\n",
    "In addition to sampling from the learned distribution, a generative model can assign a probability to any element that the distribution covers: in this case, any sequence of tokens in the corpus. We apply the chain rule, which is greatly simplified by the Markov assumption. Let $q$ be the model's probability distribution. We calculate the probability of a sequence $A$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q\\Bigg(\\bigcap_{k=1}^n A_k\\Bigg) \n",
    "   = \\prod_{k=1}^n q\\Bigg(A_k \\,\\Bigg|\\, \\bigcap_{j=1}^{k-1} A_j\\Bigg)\n",
    "   = \\prod_{k=1}^n q(A_k | A_{k-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid underflow errors (among other theoretical motivations), we use surprisal (i.e. negative log probability) in the place of probability. Because $log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)$, the product becomes a sum. And because we want our metric to be neutral to the length of the sequence, we take the average surprisal. Finally, in order to make differences in models sound more impressive to journal editors, we take the exponentiation of average surprisal to get perplexity.\n",

    "## Smoothing and unknown words\n",
    "So, everything is looking great. We can generate sentences and even assign probabilities to new sentences! Look, see how--wait, `ValueError: math domain error`--what the heck? It looks we tried to take the logarithm of 0... Our `defaultdict` matrix just did its job and this is how it gets repaid!\n",
    "\n",
    "For any open vocabulary modeling task, we need a way to handle never-before-seen word transitions. These transitions come in two flavors: bigrams with a new word, or bigrams with old words that never occurred together. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unknown words\n",
    "There are a few ways to handle the first case. We do not just want to assign some low probability to any bigram with a new word. Some words will be commonly followed by new words, while others will almost never (e.g. \"the\" and \"go\" respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can learn about the distribution of new words by treating them like rare words in the test corpus. One way to do this is to replace the first occurrence of every word with `UNKNOWN_TOKEN`. For the model, that word was unknown at the time, so this makes some sense. However, this will result in common words being marked as unknown once, which may distort the distribution. Thus, we also explored a strategy of marking words by their absolute occurrence count. Below is a plot showing perplexity and unigram probability of `UNKNOWN_TOKEN` (scaled) for the \"first occurrence\" strategy and different cutoff frequency for rare words. This plot is generated by `test_unknown_methods()`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Effect of track_rare on perplexity and `UNKNOWN_TOKEN` probability](unknown_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that perplexity will inversely correlate with unknown probability because this replaces surprising tokens with one increasingly common token. In the limit, every token is unknown, and the perplexity is 0. However, the fact that perplexity decreases from \"first occurrence\" to \"occurs once\" while unknown probability decreases as well indicates that the cutoff method is genuinely better than the \"first occurrence\" method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unseen bigrams\n",
    "Handling unseen bigrams is a specific instance of the more general problem of smoothing to avoid overfitting. This ammounts to moving some of the probability mass from seen bigrams to unseen bigrams. We can view this as the model sacrificing some of its knowledge about the training set to achieve better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented Good-Turing smoothing for all tokens that occur less than five times. We are able to apply the smoothing to only certain tokens wihout invalidating the distribution because we adjust counts, not the probabilities themselves. Below is our implementation of the following function, where $c$ is a bigram count and $N_c$ is the number of bigrams that have that count.\n",

Now we simply apply this function to every element in our cooccurrence matrix and proceed as before, provided that we have a supercomputer or lots of time. Applying this mapping destroys the sparsity of our matrix, something our performance depends heavily on. Thus, we need a way to apply the Good-Turing mapping as a filter between the raw counts from the matrix and the probability calculation to find:\n",

To avoid this, we cae use the previously computed `count_counts`. We restate $GoodTuring(\\#(x, t))$ as $\\sum_c GoodTuring(c) N_c$ (proof can't fit in 6 pages). Note that `count_counts` doesn't suffer from the same time complexity problem because it calculates zero counts as the total number of possible bigrams minus the number of seen bigrams.\n",

The basic idea is very intuitive: train a model on each of the genre training sets and then find the perplexity of each model on a test book. We expect that the models will have learned some domain specific knowledge, and will thus be least _perplexed_ by the test book.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we found that this approach did not work: the crime model did too well. Our first thought was to blindly throw machine learning at the problem (see `svc_classify()`), but this worked even worse than our simple rule. So we decided to examine the perplexity matrix in the hopes of diagnosing the problem:\n",

    "For the extension, we chose to employ our n-gram model in the service of an NLP application. We created a Sublime Text plugin, BigramsCompleteMe^[https://github.com/fredcallaway/BigramsCompleteMe], which sorts autocompletion results based on the probability given the previously typed word. (See the linked Github page for a demonstration and installation instructions). The plugin is designed to be used for editing text files, including plain text, \\LaTeX, and markdown (which this document was written in).\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of the tool derives from the improved `insert_best_completion` performance, with the goal of increasing typing speed by saving the writer from typing long words and phrases repeatedly. It is not clear how Sublime Text's default sorting algorithm works, but it is some combination of frequency and recency. This is highly effective for editing source code which has a small number of unique words that tend to be locally clustered. However it leaves much to be desired for natural language text completion. Because \n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the plugin only uses the `Distribution` class because at each completion, only the bigrams beginning with one word are relevant. Calling the full model causes noticeable delay as the file approaches 5000 words. It is difficult to know when a user has deleted a word, thus retraining upon every completion is the only straightforward and reliable option. However, future versions of the plugin could use pre-trained `BigramModels`, which could come packaged with the plugin or be user-generated with a Sublime Text command."
